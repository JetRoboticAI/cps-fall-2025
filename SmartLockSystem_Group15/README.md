Something to notice before running the code:
1. To make sure the entire program runs properly, please add a folder called "fingerprints" prior to running fingerprint_controller.py or web_control.py
2. To use offline version (command line prompt), please direct to the target folder and do "python3 fingerprint_controller.py". Remember to have all environment setup before doing this.
3. To use online version, please do "python3 web_control.py", then the server will start automatically. To use the website, please use your browser from another computer to connect to the raspberry pi under the same WiFi. Port number is 8080, and to check the IP address, please use your mouse to move cursor to the WiFi icon on raspberry pi. To connect, please use IPaddress:8080
